# Computational Neuroscience Assignment

This is a GitHub repository hosting an assignment on Computational Neuroscience. The assignment explores the Hodgkin-Huxley Neuron Model and its implementation in MATLAB. The aim of the assignment is to simulate the HH Model and analyze the variation of voltage spiking frequency with change in input impulse current.

## Contents

The repository contains the following files:

- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the repository.
- `BT6270_A1.pdf`: The PDF file containing the assignment report.
- `HHModel.m`: The MATLAB code implementing the Hodgkin-Huxley Neuron Model.
- some plots.

## Contributing
